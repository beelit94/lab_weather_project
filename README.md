### Project: Climate Change Impact Dashboard

Objective: Build a Python web application that allows users to:

1.  View historical weather data for a given city or set of coordinates.
2.  Visualize long-term trends (e.g., temperature rise over decades, changing rainfall patterns) that are indicative of climate change.
3.  Access information about climate change impacts specific to that location (e.g., risk of wildfires, flooding, etc.)

Key Components:

1.  Data Ingestion:

    -   Use public APIs or datasets to fetch historical weather data for a given city or set of coordinates. Datasets might include temperature, sea level, precipitation, etc. You could use sources like NOAA, NASA, or other national meteorological agencies.
2.  Data Storage:

    -   Store the fetched climate data in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) with appropriate historical tracking.
3.  Data Processing and Analysis:

    -   Write Python functions to process the data and calculate trends over time (e.g., linear regression on temperature data to show warming trends).
    -   Identify notable patterns and events (e.g., record-breaking temperatures, decreasing snowfall, etc.)
4.  Climate Impact Information:

    -   Integrate additional datasets or information sources that highlight the potential impacts of climate change for the selected location (e.g., wildfire risk, flood risk, etc.)
5.  Web Interface:

    -   Create a web interface using a Python web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) that allows users to:
        -   Enter a city or coordinates to fetch and display the historical climate data.
        -   View visualizations of long-term climate trends for that location.
        -   Access information on potential climate change impacts specific to that location.

Steps to Complete the Project:

1.  Set Up Your Environment:

    -   Install Python, the necessary libraries (e.g., `requests` for API calls, `matplotlib` or `Plotly` for visualizations, `Flask` for the web interface), and a database system of your choice.
2.  Fetch Historical Climate Data:

    -   Find a public dataset or API with historical weather data.
    -   Write a Python function that uses the `requests` library or another method to fetch this data for a given location.
3.  Store Climate Data:

    -   Set up a database and define the schema for storing the climate data.
    -   Write a Python function that takes the dataset and stores the relevant data in the database.
4.  Process and Analyze Climate Data:

    -   Write Python functions to query the database, analyze the data, and identify long-term trends indicative of climate change.
5.  Integrate Climate Impact Information:

    -   Find datasets or sources of information about climate change impacts (e.g., wildfire risk maps, floodplain maps).
    -   Integrate this information into the application, making it accessible based on the user's selected location.
6.  Build the Web Interface:

    -   Use Flask or Django to set up a simple web application.
    -   Create HTML templates for the user interface, including interactive visualizations of the climate data.
    -   Write routes that handle user input, fetch and process data, and render the templates with the data.
7.  Test the Application:

    -   Test the application locally, ensure that it works as expected, and make any necessary fixes.
8.  Optional (For Advanced Users):

    -   Deploy the application to a cloud service or a server.
