# Project: Real-Time Weather Dashboard
Objective: Build a Python web application that allows users to view the current weather for a given location and see historical weather data for the past week.

Key Components:

Data Ingestion:
Use a public API, such as the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch current weather data for a given city or set of coordinates.
Data Storage:
Store the fetched weather data in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) for historical tracking. Store data like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and timestamps.
Data Processing:
Write Python functions to process the data and calculate useful metrics (e.g., average temperature for the past week, the most common weather condition, etc.).
Web Interface:
Create a simple web interface using a Python web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) that allows users to:
Enter a city or coordinates to fetch the current weather.
View the historical weather data for that location for the past week.
See processed metrics (e.g., average temperature for the past week).
Steps to Complete the Project:

Set Up Your Environment:

Install Python, the necessary libraries (e.g., requests for API calls, Flask for the web interface), and a database system of your choice.
Fetch Weather Data:

Register for an API key from a weather service like OpenWeatherMap.
Write a Python function that uses the requests library to fetch current weather data for a given location using the API.
Store Weather Data:

Set up a database and define the schema for storing weather data.
Write a Python function that takes the API response and stores the relevant data in the database.
Process Weather Data:

Write Python functions to query the database and calculate useful metrics based on the historical data.
Build the Web Interface:

Use Flask or Django to set up a simple web application.
Create HTML templates for the user interface.
Write routes that handle user input, fetch and process data, and render the templates with the data.
Test the Application:

Test the application locally, ensure that it works as expected, and make any necessary fixes.
Optional (For Advanced Users):

Deploy the application to a cloud service or a server.
Add the ability to visualize the historical weather data using a library like Chart.js or Plotly.
